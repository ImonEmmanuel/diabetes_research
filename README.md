# Diabetes Research Project

## Overview

This project aims to analyze and predict diabetes-related outcomes using various machine learning algorithms. The research is conducted in Python, leveraging popular data science libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib. The project also includes a research paper detailing the methodology, experiments, and findings.

## AIM
The current study examined historical trends of diabetes care in patients with diabetes admitted to a US hospital in order to guide future paths that could lead to improvements in patient safety. Early hospital readmissions are being reduced as a policy priority to improve healthcare quality. In this case study, we look at how machine learning can assist in resolving challenges created by readmission.
